BACKGROUND
==========

The BCT Framework is a small, flexible PHP web and web services
framework designed to contain most functionality in plugins.

It was built for a single project but I've ended up using it 
for many other things, and I thought it might be useful to the 
Open Source community. 

Please refer to the included documentation for more details.

FEATURES
========

- Pluggable 
- Light weight
- Sophisticated events system
- Abstracted database layer
- MVC architecture
- Virtual pages 
- Object/Metadata based data model
