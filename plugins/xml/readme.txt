XML Support.

Adds xml support for the BCT platform including XML export views for data objects and API.

@section IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:

As with all object export code, by default it will export all fields attached to an object. If any of
these are sensitive you should provide an export view for the specific object and hide these fields.
