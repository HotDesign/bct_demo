	/**
	 * \mainpage BCT Platform
	 * Welcome to the Barcamp Transparency Platform.
	 * 
	 * This is a flexible and powerful PHP web and web services framework initially developed by
	 * <a href="http://www.marcus-povey.co.uk">Marcus Povey</a> for the <a href="http://www.barcamptransparency.org">Barcamp Transparency project</a>,
	 * but is now used for much much more.
	 * 
	 * \section Installation
	 *
	 * \subsection prerequisites Before you begin
	 * Before you begin, you should make sure the following pre-requisites are met:
	 *	- Apache (2 is recommended)
	 *	- PHP 5.2 or greater as a module (or CLI if you intend to use the library
	 *	    for scripting only.
	 *	- modrewrite module for apache
	 *
	 * This should be sufficient to get the core platform files to boot without error, however many plugins
	 * will require extra functionality. Here are some common ones:
	 *	- PHP5-mysql (infact you will almost certainly need this)
	 *	- PHP5-GD (for anything that does image manipulation, for example the profile plugin)
	 * \endsubsection
	 *
	 * \subsection files Installing files
	 * Installation should be fairly straightforward for anyone familiar to installing stuff on
	 * webservers:
	 *
	 *	- Install the core files in a suitable directory on your web server
	 *	- Rename htaccess_dist to .htaccess and modify it accordingly. If you are installing on docroot, this can
	 *	    probably be left unmodified. Sub directories will require the rewrite_base directive to be set.
	 *	- Rename settings.example.php to settings.php and configure accordingly.
	 *	- If you plan on using the database (most likely), install the appropriate schema from engine/schema/. Set the
	 *	    prefix as appropriate in settings.php
	 * \endsubsection
	 *
	 * \subsection plugins Installing plugins
	 * By default plugins are installed to /plugins in their own subdirectory, for example the "foo" plugin would be installed
	 * to /plugins/foo.
	 *
	 * Once you've installed the files for your new plugin you should enable it in settings.php.
	 *
	 * @note A common gotcha when developing / installing plugins is forgetting to clear the caches and so failing
	 *	to find new views. A simple way of avoiding this is to set $CONFIG->disable_cache = true; on your development
	 *	machines.
	 * \endsubsection
	 *
	 * \subsection configuration Configuration
	 *  As mentioned above, configuration is performed in /engine/settings.php, plugin configuration options are typically listed
	 *  in their documentation.
	 * \subsubsection perdomain Per-domain configuration
	 * A powerful feature of the BCT framework is the ability to set per domain configurations. Per domain configs load allow you to
	 * automatically load a different configuration file based on the incoming domain requested.
	 *
	 * Of all the possibilities this gives you not least is the ability to run multiple different sites off a single
	 * installation of the code, making management considerably easier.
	 *
	 * To take advantage of this:
	 *	- Enable $CONFIG->per_domain_config = true; in settings.php
	 *	- Create a config file for your domain called: settings.FQDN.php, for example settings.example.com.php
	 * \endsubsubsection
	 *
	 * \endsubsection
